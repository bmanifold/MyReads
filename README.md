# MyReads Project

This is my solution for the MyReads project for Udacity's React nano degree.  This projected was started from the [udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) repo.

## Getting Started

It is assummed that you have NodeJS installed.  If you do not, please see the [NodeJS Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. Note: This application was written and tested using `NodeJS v10.15.0`

To run the application in this repository:

* Install all project dependencies using either `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
